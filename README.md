# PythonFundamentals-2021-2022

Hi all. This repository will be used to upload anything I think you may find useful during the course of this module. This could be examples, task solutions or best practices. Please feel free to explore and take what code you need for inspiration.

This repository will be in use by a couple of my classes studying fundamental Python, so hopefully that should mean we end up with a very broad range of code samples to review.
